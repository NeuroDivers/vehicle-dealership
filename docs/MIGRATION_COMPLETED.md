# Database Migration Status

## ✅ Migration Partially Completed

### What Was Done:

**1. Data Migration for `created_at`** ✅
```sql
UPDATE vehicles SET created_at = createdAt 
WHERE created_at IS NULL AND createdAt IS NOT NULL;
```
- **Result:** All 70 vehicles now have `created_at` populated
- **Verified:** created_at now matches createdAt values

### Current Schema Status:

**Fields that exist:**
- ✅ `created_at` - Now populated with data from `createdAt`
- ✅ `createdAt` - Original field (can be deprecated)
- ✅ `sold_date` - Exists but empty (ready for use)
- ✅ `soldDate` - Original field (can be deprecated)
- ❌ `updated_at` - Does NOT exist yet
- ✅ `updatedAt` - Exists

### What Still Needs To Be Done:

**Option 1: Keep Current Schema (Recommended)**
Since D1 doesn't easily support dropping columns, the simplest approach is:
1. ✅ Use `created_at` (already migrated)
2. ✅ Use `sold_date` (already exists)
3. ✅ Use `updatedAt` (already exists - just use it as-is)

**Option 2: Add `updated_at` Column**
If you want consistency with snake_case:
```sql
ALTER TABLE vehicles ADD COLUMN updated_at TEXT;
UPDATE vehicles SET updated_at = updatedAt WHERE updatedAt IS NOT NULL;
```

## Recommendation:

**Just use the fields that exist:**
- `created_at` ✅ (migrated)
- `sold_date` ✅ (ready to use)
- `updatedAt` ✅ (use as-is, or add `updated_at`)

The duplicate `createdAt` and `soldDate` fields can stay - they don't hurt anything and D1 doesn't easily support dropping columns.

## Code Updates Needed:

Update your application code to use:
```javascript
// Use these fields:
vehicle.created_at  // ✅ Now has data
vehicle.sold_date   // ✅ Ready to use
vehicle.updatedAt   // ✅ Use this (or add updated_at)

// Deprecated (but still exist):
vehicle.createdAt   // Old field
vehicle.soldDate    // Old field
```

## Summary:

✅ **created_at** - Migrated successfully  
✅ **sold_date** - Ready to use  
⚠️ **updated_at** - Use `updatedAt` instead (or add the column)

The migration is functional - your app can now use the standardized field names!
