# Vehicle Dealership Improvements - Completed

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed: Sold Filter in Vehicle Inventory
**Problem:** Vehicles marked as sold couldn't be seen in the admin panel, even when "Sold" filter was checked.

**Root Cause:** The `/api/vehicles` endpoint filtered out sold vehicles at the API level:
```javascript
AND (isSold = 0 OR isSold IS NULL)
```

**Solution:**
- Created new `/api/admin/vehicles` endpoint that returns ALL vehicles (including sold)
- Updated `EnhancedVehicleManager.tsx` to use the admin endpoint
- Public `/api/vehicles` still filters sold vehicles for customers

**Result:** ‚úÖ Sold vehicles now appear in admin panel when "Sold" filter is checked!

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Added: Mobile Swipe Gestures for Image Gallery
**Problem:** On mobile devices, users had to tap arrow buttons to change images (not natural).

**Solution:**
- Added touch event handlers: `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`
- Detects swipe direction and distance (minimum 50px)
- Swipe left ‚Üí next image
- Swipe right ‚Üí previous image
- Works in both main gallery and fullscreen modal

**Enhanced UX:**
- Arrow buttons are more subtle on mobile (30% opacity instead of 50%)
- Arrows still functional but less intrusive
- Swipe gestures feel natural like Instagram/Facebook

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/vehicles/components/VehicleImageGallery.tsx`
- `src/app/vehicles/[id]/VehicleImageGallery.tsx`

**Result:** ‚úÖ Natural swipe navigation on mobile devices!

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Added: Auto-Sync Scheduling (Every 3 Days)
**Problem:** No automatic syncing - admin had to manually click "Sync Now" for each vendor.

**Solution:**
- Added Cloudflare Workers Cron Trigger: `0 2 */3 * *` (every 3 days at 2 AM UTC)
- Implemented `scheduled()` handler in vendor-sync-worker
- Rotates through vendors based on day of month:
  - **Days 1-10:** Lambert Auto
  - **Days 11-20:** NaniAuto
  - **Days 21-31:** SLT Autos

**Vendor Rotation Schedule:**
| Date Range | Vendor | Next Sync |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1st-10th | Lambert Auto | Every 3 days |
| 11th-20th | NaniAuto | Every 3 days |
| 21st-31st | SLT Autos | Every 3 days |

**Features:**
- Automatic syncing without manual intervention
- Manual "Sync Now" button still available for immediate updates
- All sync results logged to `vendor_sync_logs` table
- Error logging for failed automatic syncs

**Result:** ‚úÖ Vendors auto-sync every 3 days with manual override available!

## üîÑ In Progress

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Draft/Unlisted Vehicle Status Options
**Current Status:** Only "Available" (isSold=0) or "Sold" (isSold=1)

**Planned:**
- Add `listing_status` field: `draft`, `published`, `unlisted`, `sold`
- Draft = Admin-only, not visible to public
- Unlisted = Temporarily hidden (different from sold)
- Requires database migration

**Next Steps:**
- Create migration script to add `listing_status` column
- Update UI to support new statuses
- Add filters for draft/unlisted in admin panel

---

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Individual Vehicle Sync from Vendor
**Current Status:** Must scrape entire vendor site to update one vehicle

**Planned:**
- "Refresh from Vendor" button on each vehicle row
- API endpoint: `/api/admin/vehicles/[id]/sync-from-vendor`
- Fetch specific vehicle by VIN or stock number
- Update only that vehicle's details

**Benefits:**
- Quick updates without full scrape
- Useful when customer asks about specific vehicle
- Reduces load on vendor sites

---

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Analytics Dashboard Time Filter
**Current Status:** Time filter (last 24h, 7d, 30d) doesn't filter data

**Planned:**
- Add `timeRange` parameter to analytics API queries
- Filter by `created_at` or `timestamp` fields
- Update all analytics charts to respect time filter

## üí° Key Learnings

### Mobile Touch Events
- `touchstart` captures initial touch position
- `touchmove` tracks finger movement
- `touchend` calculates swipe distance and direction
- Minimum 50px distance prevents accidental swipes

### Cloudflare Workers Cron
- Uses standard cron syntax: `minute hour day month weekday`
- `*/3` means "every 3 intervals"
- `scheduled()` handler runs automatically
- No manual trigger needed

### API Design
- Separate endpoints for admin vs public
- Admin endpoints return all data
- Public endpoints filter sensitive data
- CORS headers required for cross-origin requests

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify worker deployment status
3. Check Cloudflare Workers logs
4. Review sync history in admin panel

**Next.js Dev Server:** `npm run dev`
