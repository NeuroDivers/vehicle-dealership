# Vendor Sync Improvements - December 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Sync History Only Shows Lambert
**Problem:** NaniAuto and SLT Autos syncs weren't appearing in Sync History table

**Root Cause:** Only Lambert was logging sync operations to the `vendor_sync_logs` table

**Fix Applied:**
- Added database logging to `syncNaniAuto()` function
- Added database logging to `syncSLTAutos()` function
- Both now insert records into `vendor_sync_logs` with:
  - vendor_id
  - vendor_name
  - sync_date
  - vehicles_found
  - new_vehicles
  - updated_vehicles
  - status
  - sync_duration_seconds

**Result:** All vendor syncs now appear in Sync History! 🎉

### 2. ✅ Grace Period Implemented
**Problem:** Vehicles were immediately marked as "unlisted" when they disappeared from vendor feeds

**What Grace Period Does:**
- Waits 3 days before marking a vehicle as "unlisted"
- Prevents false "unavailable" messages due to temporary feed glitches
- Gives vendors time to fix feed issues

**How It Works:**

**Day 0:** Vehicle appears in vendor feed
- Status: `active`
- `last_seen_from_vendor`: Today

**Days 1-3:** Vehicle missing from feed (Grace Period)
- Status: Still `active` ✅ (not changed)
- Vehicle remains fully available on site
- No "unavailable" badge shown

**Day 4+:** Grace period expires
- If still missing from vendor feed
- Status: Changed to `unlisted`
- Vehicle shows "Call for Availability" badge

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Grace period: 3 days
const gracePeriodDays = 3;

UPDATE vehicles 
SET vendor_status = 'unlisted'
WHERE 
  vendor_id = ? 
  AND vin NOT IN (current feed)
  AND (
    last_seen_from_vendor IS NULL 
    OR datetime(last_seen_from_vendor, '+3 days') <= datetime('now')
  )
```

**Applied To:**
- ✅ Lambert Auto (line 271-289)
- ✅ NaniAuto (line 736-760)
- ✅ SLT Autos (line 972-996)

## Settings Explanation

### Sync Frequency
**What it controls:** How often automatic syncs should run

**Options:**
- `hourly` - Every hour
- `daily` - Once per day (recommended)
- `weekly` - Once per week  
- `manual` - Only when you click "Sync Now"

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**
- Setting exists in UI but doesn't trigger automatic syncs
- All syncs must be manual via "Sync Now" button
- To implement: Would need Cloudflare Workers Cron Triggers

**Example Future Implementation:**
```toml
# In wrangler.toml
[triggers]
crons = ["0 */1 * * *"]  # Every hour for hourly vendors
```

---

### Grace Period Days
**What it controls:** Days to wait before marking vehicle as "unlisted"

**Current Value:** 3 days (hardcoded)

**Status:** ✅ **NOW IMPLEMENTED!**

**How It Works:**
1. Vehicle disappears from vendor feed
2. System waits 3 days (grace period)
3. If still missing after 3 days → marked as "unlisted"
4. If vehicle reappears within 3 days → stays "active"

**Benefits:**
- Prevents false "unavailable" messages
- Handles temporary vendor feed glitches
- More reliable customer experience

---

### Auto Remove After Days
**What it should do:** Days after "unlisted" before hiding vehicle from public view

**Default Value:** 7 days

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

**How It Should Work:**

**Day 0:** Vehicle marked as "unlisted"
- Visible on site with "Call for Availability" badge
- Customers can still inquire

**Days 1-7:** Unlisted period
- Still visible but marked as potentially unavailable
- Sales team can still show it

**Day 8:** Auto-remove triggers
- Vehicle hidden from public listings
- Database record retained for history
- Only visible in admin dashboard

**To Implement:**
```javascript
// Run daily cron job
UPDATE vehicles 
SET vendor_status = 'removed'
WHERE 
  vendor_status = 'unlisted'
  AND datetime(updated_at, '+7 days') <= datetime('now')
```

---

## Database Schema

### `vendor_sync_logs` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS vendor_sync_logs (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  vendor_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  vendor_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  sync_date DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  vehicles_found INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  new_vehicles INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  updated_vehicles INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  removed_vehicles INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  unlisted_vehicles INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'success',
  error_message TEXT,
  sync_duration_seconds INTEGER
);
```

### `vehicles` Table (Relevant Fields)
```sql
vendor_status TEXT DEFAULT 'active', -- 'active', 'unlisted', 'removed'
last_seen_from_vendor DATETIME,      -- Last time in vendor feed
updated_at DATETIME,                  -- Last update timestamp
isSold INTEGER DEFAULT 0,             -- Sold by dealership
vendor_id TEXT,                       -- Which vendor (lambert, naniauto, sltautos)
vendor_name TEXT                      -- Vendor display name
```

## Deployment

**Worker Deployed:** ✅ `vendor-sync-worker`
**Version:** `b30950e0-3961-4cd6-a60d-3ae981bbe8df`
**URL:** `https://vendor-sync-worker.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev`

**Changes:**
- NaniAuto sync now logs to database
- SLT Autos sync now logs to database
- All vendors now implement 3-day grace period

---

## Testing

### Test Grace Period
1. Run a vendor sync (Lambert, NaniAuto, or SLT)
2. Note which vehicles are in the feed
3. Remove a vehicle from vendor's website
4. Run sync again immediately
   - **Expected:** Vehicle stays "active" (grace period)
5. Wait 3+ days, run sync again
   - **Expected:** Vehicle marked as "unlisted"

### Test Sync History
1. Go to Admin → Vendor Management
2. Sync Lambert → Should appear in history ✅
3. Sync NaniAuto → Should appear in history ✅
4. Sync SLT Autos → Should appear in history ✅

## Future Improvements

### High Priority
1. ⚠️ Implement Auto-Remove After Days
   - Create scheduled worker to check unlisted vehicles
   - Hide vehicles after specified days

2. ⚠️ Make Settings Editable
   - Create vendors table in database
   - Allow changing grace period per vendor
   - Allow changing auto-remove days per vendor

### Medium Priority
3. ⚠️ Implement Automatic Syncing
   - Use Cloudflare Cron Triggers
   - Respect sync_frequency setting
   - Run syncs without manual intervention

4. ⚠️ Add Unlisted Count to Stats
   - Show count of unlisted vehicles per vendor
   - Track unlisted vehicles in sync logs

### Low Priority
5. ⚠️ Email Notifications
   - Alert when sync fails
   - Alert when many vehicles become unlisted
   - Weekly sync summary

---

## Summary

**Fixed Today:**
- ✅ Sync history now shows all vendors (Lambert, NaniAuto, SLT)
- ✅ Grace period implemented (3 days before marking unlisted)
- ✅ All vendor syncs log to database properly

**Still TODO:**
- ⚠️ Auto-remove after days (hiding old unlisted vehicles)
- ⚠️ Automatic syncing based on frequency
- ⚠️ Editable vendor settings in UI

**Impact:**
- More accurate sync history
- Fewer false "unavailable" messages
- Better handling of temporary vendor feed issues
- More reliable customer experience
