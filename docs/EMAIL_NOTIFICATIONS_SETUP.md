## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Email Worker

cd workers

npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler-email-notification.toml

# Set secrets
npx wrangler secret put ZOHO_EMAIL_USER --config wrangler-email-notification.toml

# Enter: your_zoho_password

npx wrangler secret put STAFF_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL --config wrangler-email-notification.toml
# Enter: nick@neurodivers.ca
```

---

### Step 2: Update Frontend to Call Worker

#### Financing Application Form

```typescript
// src/app/financing/apply/page.tsx
async function handleSubmit(formData) {
  // 1. Save to database
  const response = await fetch('/api/financing-applications', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(formData)
  });
  
  const { applicationId } = await response.json();
  
  // 2. Send minimal notification to staff
  await fetch('https://email-notification-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/notify/financing', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      customerName: formData.firstName + ' ' + formData.lastName,
      vehicleName: `${vehicle.year} ${vehicle.make} ${vehicle.model}`,
      vehicleId: vehicle.id,
      applicationId: applicationId
    })
  });
  
  // 3. Show success message to customer
  setSuccess(true);
}
```

#### Test Drive Form

```typescript
// src/components/TestDriveForm.tsx
async function handleSubmit(formData) {
  // Save to database
  await fetch('/api/test-drives', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(formData)
  });
  
  // Send notification
  await fetch('https://email-notification-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/notify/test-drive', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      customerName: formData.name,
      vehicleName: `${vehicle.year} ${vehicle.make} ${vehicle.model}`,
      preferredDate: formData.preferredDate
    })
  });
}
```

[View Full Application Details] (Button)

---
This is an automated notification. Do not reply to this email.
To view full application details, please log in to the admin dashboard.
```

---

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ What We Do:
1. **Minimal data in emails** - Only name and vehicle
2. **Sensitive data stays in database** - Income, SSN, credit info never emailed
3. **Secure links** - Dashboard requires authentication
4. **No reply emails** - Prevents accidental data leaks
5. **Encrypted storage** - Database is encrypted at rest

### ‚ùå What We Don't Do:
1. Never email full application details
2. Never include SSN/SIN in emails
3. Never include bank account numbers
4. Never include credit scores
5. Never include employment verification docs

---

## Testing

### Test Email Notification:

```bash
curl -X POST https://email-notification-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/notify/financing \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerName": "Test Customer",
    "vehicleName": "2014 Dodge Grand Caravan",
    "vehicleId": "123",
    "applicationId": "app-123"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Email received at nick@neurodivers.ca
- Contains minimal info only
- Link to dashboard works
- No sensitive data in email

---

## Monitoring

### Check Email Delivery:

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

   ```bash
   npx wrangler tail email-notification-worker
   ```

2. **Verify secrets are set:**

   ```

3. **Test Zoho SMTP:**
   - Try sending test email from Zoho webmail
   - Check SMTP settings

### Emails Going to Spam?

1. Add SPF record (see ZOHO_MAIL_SETUP.md)
