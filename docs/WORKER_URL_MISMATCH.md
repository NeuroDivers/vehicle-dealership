# Worker URL Mismatch Issue

## Problem Identified

Your application is calling:
```
https://vehicle-dealership-api.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev
```

But your worker is deployed to:
```
https://vehicle-dealership-analytics.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev
```

## This is why you're getting 404 errors!

The worker exists and has all the endpoints, but the app is calling the wrong URL.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Environment Variable (Recommended)

Update your `.env.local` or environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_URL=https://vehicle-dealership-analytics.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev
```

Then rebuild your Next.js app:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Option 2: Add Custom Route in Cloudflare

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Workers & Pages → vehicle-dealership-analytics
3. Settings → Triggers → Routes
4. Add route: `vehicle-dealership-api.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev/*`

### Option 3: Rename Worker

Rename the worker in `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
name = "vehicle-dealership-api"  # Change from vehicle-dealership-analytics
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Current Status

**Worker Deployed:** ✅
- Name: vehicle-dealership-analytics
- URL: https://vehicle-dealership-analytics.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev
- Version: e83d577a-6ee0-49c6-9595-bd113ada394e
- Has all endpoints including /api/analytics/track-search

**App Configuration:** ❌
- Calling: vehicle-dealership-api.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev
- This URL doesn't exist!

## Quick Fix

Run these commands:

```bash
# Set the correct URL
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_API_URL="https://vehicle-dealership-analytics.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev"

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Or for production, update your .env.production file
```

## Verification

After fixing, test the endpoint:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://vehicle-dealership-analytics.nick-damato0011527.workers.dev/api/analytics/track-search" -Method POST -Headers @{"Content-Type"="application/json"} -Body '{"query":"test","source":"test","url":"test","user_agent":"test"}'
```

Should return 200 OK instead of 404.
