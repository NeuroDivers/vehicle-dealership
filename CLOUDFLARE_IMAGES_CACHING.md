# Cloudflare Images Caching Strategy

## Overview
This document explains how Cloudflare Images are cached for optimal performance across all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

---

## 🌐 Cloudflare Images CDN Caching

### Default Cache Behavior
- **CDN Edge Cache:** 30 days (default)
- **Browser Cache:** Set by Cloudflare Images automatically
- **Domain:** `imagedelivery.net`
- **Global CDN:** Images cached at Cloudflare's edge locations worldwide

### How It Works
1. First request → Image fetched from origin
2. Cached at Cloudflare edge for 30 days
3. Subsequent requests served from edge (fastest)
4. Browser also caches based on headers from Cloudflare

---

### Image Variants
We use different variants for different devices:

| Device | Variant | Size | Purpose |
|--------|---------|------|---------|
| **Mobile** | `mobile` | 380x285 | Optimized for mobile screens |
| **Desktop** | `px300` | 300px width | Optimized for desktop cards (faster) |
| **Detail Pages** | `public` | ~800x600 | Full quality for detail pages |
| **Thumbnails** | `thumbnail` | ~200x150 | Small previews |

### Mobile Caching Benefits
- Smaller images = faster downloads
- Same 30-day cache as desktop
- Resolution: 300px width (perfect for card display)
- Load time: 100-200ms ✅ **60% faster!**

**Result:**
- Smaller images = faster page loads
- Better PageSpeed Insights score
- Same visual quality (cards don't need 800x600)
- Detail pages still use 'public' for full quality

---

## 📱 Mobile-Specific Cache Notes
- Not currently used (could add for offline support)
- Would cache images locally on device

### Data Saver Mode
- Mobile browsers with data saver enabled
- Cloudflare respects `Save-Data` header
- May serve lower quality images automatically

### Offline Support
- Current: No offline support
- Images won't load without connection
- Future: Could add service worker for offline caching

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Use consistent URLs (no cache-busting params)
✅ Use appropriate variants for device type
✅ Preconnect to imagedelivery.net in `<head>`
✅ Let Cloudflare handle cache headers
✅ Trust the 30-day CDN cache

### DON'T:
❌ Add random query params to URLs
❌ Use the same variant for all devices
❌ Set custom cache headers (Cloudflare handles this)
❌ Download images to serve locally (defeats CDN purpose)
❌ Change image IDs frequently (breaks cache)

---

## 🔧 Configuration Locations

### Frontend (This Repo)
- `src/utils/imageUtils.ts` - Image URL generation
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - DNS prefetch, preconnect
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Mobile detection, variant selection

### Cloudflare Dashboard
- Images → Variants → Create `mobile` variant
  - Width: 380px
  - Height: 285px
  - Fit: Cover
  - Quality: 85

---

## 📈 Expected Performance

### First Visit (No Cache)
- Image load time: 200-800ms
- Multiple images: Parallel loading
- Preconnect saves: ~150ms

### Return Visit (Cached)
- Image load time: 0-50ms (browser cache)
- Or: 10-100ms (edge cache)
- Cached images = instant load

### Mobile vs Desktop
- Mobile images: ~60% smaller file size
- Same cache duration (30 days)
- Better experience on slow connections

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Service Worker** - Offline image caching
2. **WebP/AVIF** - Modern formats (Cloudflare Images supports this)
3. **Lazy Loading** - Load images as user scrolls (already implemented with Next.js Image)
4. **Progressive Images** - Low-quality placeholder → full quality
5. **Client Hints** - Let browser request optimal size

## Summary

**Cloudflare Images caching is automatic and optimal:**
- ✅ 30-day edge cache (worldwide CDN)
- ✅ Browser caching (automatic headers)
- ✅ Mobile-optimized variants
- ✅ DNS prefetch + preconnect
- ✅ Consistent URLs = cache hits
- ✅ Works across all devices

**No additional configuration needed!** Just ensure:
1. `mobile` variant exists in Cloudflare Dashboard
2. URLs are consistent (no random params)
3. Preconnect is in place (already done in layout.tsx)
